        <h2>P001 : The 3n + 1 problem</h2>

<p>Consider the following algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers. Start with an integer n. If n is even, divide by 2. If n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process with the new value of n, terminating when n = 1. For example, the following sequence of numbers will be generated for n = 22:</p>

<pre><code>22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
</code></pre>

<p>It is conjectured (but not yet proven) that this algorithm will terminate at n = 1 for every integer n. Still, the conjecture holds for all integers up to at least 1, 000, 000.
For an input n, the cycle-length of n is the number of numbers generated up to and including the 1. In the example above, the cycle length of 22 is 16. Given any two numbers i and j, you are to determine the maximum cycle length over all numbers between i and j, including both endpoints.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The input will consist of a series of pairs of integers i and j, one pair of integers per line. All integers will be less than 1,000,000 and greater than 0.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>For each pair of input integers i and j, output i, j in the same order in which they appeared in the input and then the maximum cycle length for integers between and including i and j. These three numbers should be separated by one space, with all three numbers on one line and with one line of output for each line of input.</p>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre><code>1 10
100 200
201 210
900 1000
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<pre><code>1 10 20
100 200 125
201 210 89
900 1000 174
</code></pre>

<h2>P002 : Jolly Jumpers</h2>

<p>A sequence of n &gt; 0 integers is called a jolly jumper if the absolute values of the differences between successive elements take on all possible values 1 through n - 1. For instance,</p>

<pre><code>1 4 2 3
</code></pre>

<p>is a jolly jumper, because the absolute differences are 3, 2, and 1, respectively. The definition implies that any sequence of a single integer is a jolly jumper. Write a program to determine whether each of a number of sequences is a jolly jumper.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>Each line of input contains an integer n &lt; 3, 000 followed by n integers representing the sequence.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>For each line of input generate a line of output saying "Jolly" or "Not jolly".</p>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre><code>4 1 4 2 3
5 1 4 2 -1 6
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<pre><code>Jolly
Not jolly
</code></pre>
