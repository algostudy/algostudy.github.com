        <h2>P003 : WERTYU</h2>

<hr><p>A common typing error is to place your hands on the keyboard one row to the right of the correct position. Then "Q" is typed as "W" and "J" is typed as "K" and so on. Your task is to decode a message typed in this manner.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>Input consists of several lines of text. Each line may contain digits, spaces, uppercase letters (except "Q", "A", "Z"), or punctuation shown above [except back-quote (`)]. Keys labeled with words [Tab, BackSp, Control, etc.] are not represented in the input.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>You are to replace each letter or punctuation symbol by the one immediately to its left on the QWERTY keyboard shown above. Spaces in the input should be echoed in the output.</p>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre><code>O S, GOMR YPFSU/
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<pre><code>I AM FINE TODAY.
</code></pre>

<h2>P004 : Vito's Family</h2>

<hr><p>The famous gangster Vito Deadstone is moving to New York. He has a very big family there, all of them living on Lamafia Avenue. Since he will visit all his relatives very often, he wants to find a house close to them.</p>

<p>Indeed, Vito wants to minimize the total distance to all of his relatives and has blackmailed you to write a program that solves his problem.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The input consists of several test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases.
For each test case you will be given the integer number of relatives R (0 &lt; R &lt; 500) and the street numbers (also integers) S1, S2, ... , Si, ... , Sr where they live (0 &lt; Si &lt; 30, 000). Note that several relatives might live at the same street number.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>For each test case, your program must write the minimal sum of distances from the optimal Vito's house to each one of his relatives. The distance between two street numbers Si and Sj is Dij = |Si - Sj|.</p>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre><code>2
2 2 4 
3 2 4 6
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<pre><code>2
4
