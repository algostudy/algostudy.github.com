{"name":"Algorithm Study","tagline":"ALGORITHM","body":"## P001 : The 3n + 1 problem\r\nConsider the following algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers. Start with an integer n. If n is even, divide by 2. If n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process with the new value of n, terminating when n = 1. For example, the following sequence of numbers will be generated for n = 22:\r\n\r\n```\r\n22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is conjectured (but not yet proven) that this algorithm will terminate at n = 1 for every integer n. Still, the conjecture holds for all integers up to at least 1, 000, 000.\r\nFor an input n, the cycle-length of n is the number of numbers generated up to and including the 1. In the example above, the cycle length of 22 is 16. Given any two numbers i and j, you are to determine the maximum cycle length over all numbers between i and j, including both endpoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Input\r\nThe input will consist of a series of pairs of integers i and j, one pair of integers per line. All integers will be less than 1,000,000 and greater than 0.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each pair of input integers i and j, output i, j in the same order in which they appeared in the input and then the maximum cycle length for integers between and including i and j. These three numbers should be separated by one space, with all three numbers on one line and with one line of output for each line of input.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sample Input\r\n```\r\n1 10\r\n100 200\r\n201 210\r\n900 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sample Output\r\n```\r\n1 10 20\r\n100 200 125\r\n201 210 89\r\n900 1000 174\r\n```\r\n## P002 : Jolly Jumpers\r\nA sequence of n > 0 integers is called a jolly jumper if the absolute values of the differences between successive elements take on all possible values 1 through n - 1. For instance,\r\n\r\n```\r\n1 4 2 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nis a jolly jumper, because the absolute differences are 3, 2, and 1, respectively. The definition implies that any sequence of a single integer is a jolly jumper. Write a program to determine whether each of a number of sequences is a jolly jumper.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Input\r\nEach line of input contains an integer n < 3, 000 followed by n integers representing the sequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each line of input generate a line of output saying \"Jolly\" or \"Not jolly\".\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sample Input\r\n```\r\n4 1 4 2 3\r\n5 1 4 2 -1 6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sample Output\r\n```\r\nJolly\r\nNot jolly\r\n```","note":"Don't delete this file!
