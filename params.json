Many find the \"carry\" operation, where a 1 is carried from one digit position to the next, to be a significant challenge. Your job is to count the number of carry operations for each of a set of addition problems so that educators may assess their difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Input\r\nEach line of input contains two unsigned integers less than 10 digits. The last line of input contains \"0 0\".\r\n\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each line of input except the last, compute the number of carry operations that result from adding the two numbers and print them in the format shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sample Input\r\n```\r\n123 456\r\n555 555\r\n123 594\r\n0 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sample Output\r\n```\r\n0\r\n3\r\n1\r\n```\r\n　\r\n　\r\n## P006 : How Many Fibs?\r\n***\r\nRecall the definition of the Fibonacci numbers: \r\n```\r\nfibo(1) = 1\r\nfibo(2) = 2\r\nfibo(n) = fibo(n - 1) + fibo(n - 2)       (n ≥ 3)\r\n```\r\nGiven two numbers a and b, calculate how many Fibonacci numbers are in the range [a, b].\r\n\r\n\r\n### Input\r\nThe input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two non-negative integer numbers a and b. Input is terminated by a = b = 0. Otherwise, a ≤ b ≤ 10^100. The numbers a and b are given with no superfluous leading zeros.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each test case output on a single line the number of Fibonacci numbers fibo(i) with a ≤ fibo(i) ≤ b.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sample Input\r\n```\r\n10 100\r\n1234567890 9876543210\r\n0 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sample Output\r\n```\r\n5\r\n4\r\n```","google":""}
